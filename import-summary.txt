ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* README.md
* nb-configuration.xml
* nbactions.xml
* pom.xml
* proguard-project.txt
* scripts\
* scripts\deploy-maps.sh
* scripts\googlecode_upload.py
* scripts\maven-install-mapsforge.sh
* scripts\run.sh

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets\
* libs\graphhopper-0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar => app\libs\graphhopper-0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar
* libs\mapsforge-core-0.4.3.jar => app\libs\mapsforge-core-0.4.3.jar
* libs\mapsforge-map-0.4.3.jar => app\libs\mapsforge-map-0.4.3.jar
* libs\mapsforge-map-android-0.4.3.jar => app\libs\mapsforge-map-android-0.4.3.jar
* libs\mapsforge-map-reader-0.4.3.jar => app\libs\mapsforge-map-reader-0.4.3.jar
* libs\slf4j-android-1.6.1-RC1.jar => app\libs\slf4j-android-1.6.1-RC1.jar
* libs\trove-3.0.3.jar => app\libs\trove-3.0.3.jar
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
